# LabelDeck

LabelDeck is a lightweight, browser-based tool designed **for people who still need to label data by hand**.

It was built by me — a social science student — through *vibe coding*,  
to address a very real problem:

**Many people are still doing data labeling, but do not have access to automation.**

## Why LabelDeck?

In a time when large language models are widely used, manual labeling is often seen as “work that will soon disappear.”  
But in reality:

- Many students and researchers **cannot afford LLM APIs**
- Many projects **have no budget and no engineering support**
- Many studies still require **human-generated ground truth**
- Many social science students and research assistants are still doing large amounts of **repetitive, low-visibility labeling work (dirty work)**

This work is rarely seen as prestigious, and it is rarely discussed,  
yet it continues to support research, datasets, and even the models themselves.

**In many contexts, manual labeling remains the only viable option.**

LabelDeck aims to **reduce the additional burden** brought by this unavoidable repetitive work.

## How does it work?

LabelDeck turns each item to be labeled (text, images, etc.) into a **card**, and:

- Only **one card** is shown at a time
- Items are assigned to categories using **keyboard keys**
- All labeled content can always be revisited and edited

> **When too many items are presented at once, people become more tired, distracted, and prone to mistakes.**

By breaking the labeling task into one card at a time,  
LabelDeck tries to reduce **cognitive load** during labeling:

- No need to scroll back and forth in spreadsheets
- Focus only on the current judgment

This makes the labeling process more direct and easier to sustain over time.

## What does the tool support?

- 📄 Text labeling from **CSV / Excel** files  
- 🖼️ **Image folder** labeling (jpg / jpeg / png / webp / gif, etc.)  
- 🎯 Selection of **columns** and **row ranges** to label  
- ⌨️ Keyboard-based labeling to reduce repetitive mouse operations  
- 🔁 Undo and edit previous labels  
- 📋 List view where all labels remain visible  
- 📤 Export results as **CSV / XLSX** for further analysis

## Technology & Privacy

- All operations run **entirely locally**
- No backend, no server connection
- No third-party APIs
- No data upload or data collection

This makes LabelDeck suitable for:

- Student assignments
- Daily labeling work by research assistants
- Projects with limited budgets or sensitive data

## Languages

LabelDeck supports multiple interface languages, including:

- English  
- 中文  
- 日本語  
- 한국어
